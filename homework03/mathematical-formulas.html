        <h2>Linear Equations</h2>

        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

        <div class="formula">ax + b = 0</div>

        <p>where <span class="math_symbol">a</span> and <span class="math_symbol">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="math_symbol">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="math_symbol">x</span> so don't get too locked into always seeing a <span class="math_symbol">x</span> there.</p>

        <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

        <div class="formula">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</div>

        <p>where <span class="math_symbol">a</span>, <span class="math_symbol">b</span>, <span class="math_symbol">c</span> are known values and <span class="math_symbol">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="math_symbol">a</span> can't be 0.</p>

        <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

        <p><span class="math_symbol">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="math_symbol">r</span>) squared:</p>

        <div class="formula">A = &pi; * r<sup>2</sup></div>

        <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="math_symbol">D</span>):</p>

        <div class="formula">A = (&pi; / 4) * D<sup>2</sup></div>

        <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="math_symbol">C</span>):</p>

        <div class="formula">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 * &pi;</div>

        <h2>Intersection</h2>

        <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="math_symbol">A</span> and <span class="math_symbol">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>

        <div class="formula">A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</div>

        <p>That is, <span class="math_symbol">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <span class="math_symbol">x</span> is both an element of <span class="math_symbol">A</span> and an element of <span class="math_symbol">B</span>.</p>
